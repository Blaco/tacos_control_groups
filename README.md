# Taco's Control Groups
Custom ``sfm_defaultanimationgroups.cfg`` that tags literally everything (TF2 naming schema)

# Covers:

### 1.  _All models I have ever worked on_
### 2.  _Team Fortress 2_ (player models, HWM models, Robots, notable extras like Merasmus)
### 3.  _Left 4 Dead survivors_
### 4.  _Portal 2_ (Chell, P-body, Atlas, Turret, GLaDOS, Personality Cores, various extras) *
### 5.  _Half Life 2_ (original Valve Biped characters, enemy rigs, various Gmod controls) *
### 6.  _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate / Wii U original bone names *_
### 7.  _Section at the bottom for community contributions_

###### ***Work in progress**

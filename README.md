# Taco's Control Groups
Custom ``sfm_defaultanimationgroups.cfg`` that tags literally everything (TF2 naming schema)
# Made EXTREMELY redundant and over the top with the help of AI, attempting to cover every possible combination and chain length

Covers:

1. All models I have ever worked on
2. Team Fortress 2 (player models, HWM models, Robots, notable extras like Merasmus)
3. Left 4 Dead survivors
4. Half Life 2 (original Valve Biped characters, enemy rigs, various Gmod controls)*
5. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Ultimate original skeletons*
6. Section at the bottom for community contributions

*Work in progress

This can replace your original stock file if you have never modified it before, all the vanilla entries still exist at the top.
